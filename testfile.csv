PICARD: You will agree, Data, that Starfleet's orders are difficult?

PICARD: As simple as that.

PICARD: It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement for Starfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around finding how and why the life form there built it.

PICARD: Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of human information without knowing a simple word like snoop?

PICARD: It means to spy, to sneak.

PICARD: Exactly, yes.
