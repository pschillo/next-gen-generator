# sources of choice
## chakoteya
Especially well-formatted (consult chakoteya/mission_log.txt for details) compendium of single transcripts found on http://www.chakoteya.net/NextGen/episodes.htm. However, this compendium was not created by me but by an unknown user from a Star Trek forum I have not been able to credit. They also created the mission_log.txt explaining their stylistic choices concerning this dataset, which has been of great help to me in determining a suitable data format for this task.

## alternative
This is an equally correct collection of transcripts of all episodes of The Next Generation downloadable from https://www.st-minutiae.com/resources/scripts/#thenextgeneration. However, the formatting makes it additionally difficult to process the lines of individual characters. This is why I am keeping it as an alternative source for this project in case I might require it.
