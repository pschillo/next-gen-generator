# project documentation
I shall be documenting the progress of this project here.
## motivation
This project combines two things I love: Star Trek and programming.
## sources
The programme uses a complete collection of transcripts of all episodes of Star Trek - The Next Generation. I have specified two sources, "chakoteya" being the primary one based on its suitable format and standardization. Additionally, I added an alternative source with the same content and slightly worse formatting in case I require it at a later point.
The "chakoteya" dataset adheres to the British English conventions and will be used as material source for this project unless otherwise specified.
## workflow
### the Telegram bot
I started by checking boxes on the necessary formalities of a Telegram bot, i.e. registering the bot with Telegram's own "botfather", creating the bot's unique tag (nextgen_genrator_bot) and acquiring its unique token from Telegram. The tag will only be relevant for users to find the bot in the Telegram app but must be chosen upon initialization. The token enables my script to be matched with the corresponding bot, which is why it should be kept secure and is not included in any of my commits.
## result
