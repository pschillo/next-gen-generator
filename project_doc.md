# project documentation
I shall be documenting the progress of this project here.
## motivation
## sources
The programme uses a complete collection of transcripts of all episodes of Star Trek - The Next Generation. I have specified two sources, "chakoteya" being the primary one based on its suitable format and standardization. Additionally, I added an alternative source with the same content and slightly worse formatting in case I require it at a later point.
The "chakoteya" dataset adheres to the British English conventions and will be used as material source for this project unless otherwise specified.
