# next-gen-generator
I pitched this as a project "involving machine-generated speech, star trek and, quite possibly, a telegram bot". That is a good place to start.

## CONTENT OVERVIEW
- README.md: consult this file to navigate this repository.
- telegram.py: everything concerning the bot itself
- process.py: code processing raw data into usable data format
- compute.py: non-bot related code
- demo.py: run to test process functionality
- project_doc.md: I shall be documenting the progress of this project here.
- [folder] materials: this is where data and other materials are gathered for the project.
  -  StarTrek_NextGen_transcript_complete.txt: scripts of all episodes collected in one .txt file, original source: http://www.chakoteya.net/NextGen/episodes.htm
  - mission_log.txt: creator's commentary on StarTrek_NextGen_transcript_complete.txt
